(1) The disease-related genes were filterd by using the set of genes in the PPI network (9606.protein.physical.links.v11.0) downloaded from the String database. So, the number of disease-related genes used in the study is less than that of original disease-gene dataset. This is also the case for the pathways-related genes. 
(2) Table 1-2 was generated by using the API of the String database and filterd gene dataset.
